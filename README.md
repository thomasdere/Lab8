** Lab Session 5 Visualization critique:
Lacks documentation (Instructor critique)
Lacks References (Instructor critique)
Scale of the “Salary” visualization contained error and also can be modified to better fit the values of the data range
“Map” visualization needs better geographic identification for those not familiar with where “Silicon Valley” is located
Current visualizations are “Student” audience centered, so the addition of a “Recruiter” audience centered illustration could compliment the final product
More clearly defined metrics matching the Needs/Fears of the target audiences
